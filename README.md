This project was created as part of an internal school competition.

implementation for the Game of Life, the cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing howâ€¦

# The work on the project
We discussed and agreed on the structure of the code and the principles of the algorithm.
Next, we implemented two different codes implementation and compared their performance.
